Collaboration is critical for achieving team goals and fostering a positive work environment. This chapter will provide guidance on how to answer this survey question and provide sample answers.

How to Answer

When answering this survey question, rate your perceived level of collaboration on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being "not at all" and 10 being "extremely." Consider the following:

Your response should reflect your honest evaluation of the level of collaboration between team members.

Sample Answers
--------------

Here are some sample answers to the survey question:

* "I rate the level of collaboration between team members as a 9 out of 10. We communicate effectively with one another, and roles and responsibilities are clearly defined. There is a strong sense of trust and mutual respect among team members, and we are always willing to help one another."
* "I rate the level of collaboration between team members as a 6 out of 10. While we communicate with one another, sometimes roles and responsibilities are unclear, and there is a lack of trust and mutual respect among team members."
* "I rate the level of collaboration between team members as a 3 out of 10. There is no effective communication, and roles and responsibilities are often unclear. There is little trust or mutual respect among team members, which leads to a lack of collaboration."
* "I am neutral about the level of collaboration between team members. While there is some communication and collaboration, I think we could benefit from more clearly defined roles and responsibilities and a stronger sense of trust and mutual respect among team members."

Overall, the responses to this survey question can provide valuable insight into how well team members collaborate with one another. This feedback can be used to identify areas for improvement and ensure that the team is working together effectively towards achieving its goals.
