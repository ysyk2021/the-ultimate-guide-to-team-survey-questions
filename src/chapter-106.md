Effective decision-making is crucial to the success of any team. However, sometimes the decision-making process can become inefficient or ineffective, leading to frustration and missed opportunities. Asking the question "What do you think could be improved in our team's decision-making process?" in a survey can help identify ways to streamline the process, improve communication, and achieve better outcomes.

## How to Answer

When answering this question, try to be specific about your experiences with the current decision-making process. Consider what has worked well and what could be improved in terms of communication, feedback, and follow-up actions. Think about what motivates you and what you hope to achieve in your role, and how the decision-making process can support those goals.

It can be helpful to brainstorm specific actions or changes that could improve the decision-making process. For example, introducing more diverse perspectives or involving relevant stakeholders earlier in the process can lead to more informed decisions. Improving transparency and communication can also help ensure that everyone is on the same page about the decision-making process.
