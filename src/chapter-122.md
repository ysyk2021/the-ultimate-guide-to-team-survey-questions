Sample Answers

Here are some sample answers to the survey question:

* "I am very satisfied with how well the team balances its focus on short-term and long-term goals. We have a clear plan that aligns our short-term goals with our long-term vision, and we regularly review our progress towards both."
* "I am somewhat satisfied with how well the team balances its focus on short-term and long-term goals. While we do have a plan that aligns our goals, sometimes short-term goals take precedence, and we lose sight of the bigger picture."
* "I am not satisfied with how well the team balances its focus on short-term and long-term goals. There is no clear plan to achieve both short-term and long-term goals, and we tend to prioritize short-term goals over long-term goals."
* "I am neutral about how well the team balances its focus on short-term and long-term goals. While we do have a plan, I think it could be more clearly defined, and we should review our progress towards both short-term and long-term goals more frequently."

Overall, the responses to this survey question can provide valuable insight into how well a team is able to balance its focus on short-term and long-term goals. This feedback can be used to identify areas for improvement and ensure that the team is aligned towards achieving sustained success.
