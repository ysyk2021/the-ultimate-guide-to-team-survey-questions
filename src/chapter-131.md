1. **Inconsistent Recognition:** Recognition and rewards for good performance can feel inconsistent or unfair at times. We could benefit from establishing clear criteria for recognition and rewards and ensuring that they are applied consistently across the team.
2. **Lack of Timely Feedback:** Delayed feedback on good performance can make it difficult to know whether efforts are being recognized and appreciated. We could benefit from providing more timely feedback on good performance to reinforce positive behaviors.
3. **Limited Opportunities for Rewards:** Limited opportunities for rewards can make it difficult to stay motivated and engaged in the workplace. We could benefit from finding ways to provide more frequent and meaningful rewards for good performance, such as bonuses, promotions, or additional professional development opportunities.
4. **Recognition Without Rewards:** Recognition without rewards can feel superficial and not truly demonstrate appreciation for good performance. We could benefit from finding ways to combine recognition with meaningful rewards to show that good performance is truly valued and appreciated.
5. **Lack of Personalized Recognition:** Recognition and rewards that are not personalized to individual strengths and contributions can feel generic and not truly demonstrate appreciation for good performance. We could benefit from finding ways to personalize recognition and rewards to individual team members' strengths and contributions.
