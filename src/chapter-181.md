Sample Answers

Here are some sample answers to the survey question:

* "The team is very effective in encouraging and supporting ongoing education and training among members. Team members are provided with opportunities for ongoing education and training, there are clear expectations for ongoing education and training within the team, and team members are encouraged to take advantage of available educational and training opportunities. Sufficient resources are allocated towards ongoing education and training, and team members feel that their ongoing education and training needs are being met."
* "The team is somewhat effective in encouraging and supporting ongoing education and training among members. While team members are provided with opportunities for ongoing education and training, there could be more proactive efforts to ensure that all team members have access to these opportunities. However, there are clear expectations for ongoing education and training within the team, and team members are encouraged to take advantage of available educational and training opportunities. Sufficient resources are allocated towards ongoing education and training, and team members generally feel that their ongoing education and training needs are being met."
* "The team is not very effective in encouraging and supporting ongoing education and training among members. Team members are not always provided with opportunities for ongoing education and training, and there are no clear expectations for ongoing education and training within the team. Team members do not always feel encouraged to take advantage of available educational and training opportunities, and insufficient resources are allocated towards ongoing education and training. As a result, many team members feel that their ongoing education and training needs are not being met."
* "I am neutral about how well the team encourages and supports ongoing education and training among members. While team members are generally provided with opportunities for ongoing education and training, I think we could benefit from more proactive efforts to ensure that all team members have access to these opportunities. However, there are clear expectations for ongoing education and training within the team, and team members are encouraged to take advantage of available educational and training opportunities. Sufficient resources are allocated towards ongoing education and training, and most team members feel that their ongoing education and training needs are being met."

Overall, the responses to this survey question can provide valuable insight into how well the team encourages and supports ongoing education and training among members. This feedback can be used to identify areas for improvement and ensure that the team is working together effectively towards achieving its goals through continuous learning and development.
