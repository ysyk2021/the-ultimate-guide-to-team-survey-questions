Sample Answers

1. **Sufficient Recognition:** I think our team does a good job of recognizing good work. We receive regular feedback from our colleagues and managers, and feel appreciated for our contributions.
2. **Room for Improvement:** While I appreciate the current level of recognition and reward, I think there is room for improvement. For example, we could establish clearer criteria for recognition and reward or create more formalized processes for acknowledging and rewarding good work.
3. **Inconsistent Recognition:** I feel like recognition and rewards for good work are inconsistent across different teams or departments. We could work on establishing consistent standards for recognizing and rewarding good work, and ensure that all team members have an opportunity to be recognized.
4. **Lack of Transparency:** I sometimes feel like it is unclear how recognition and rewards for good work are determined or distributed. We could work on increasing transparency around our recognition and reward processes and ensuring that everyone understands how recognition and rewards are earned and awarded.
5. **More Personalization:** I believe that we could benefit from a wider variety of recognition and rewards for good work, tailored to individual team members' interests and preferences. This could include non-monetary rewards like public recognition or professional development opportunities.

Remember, the purpose of answering this survey question is to identify potential improvements to the recognition and reward system and provide feedback for improvement. By improving recognition and rewards, we can create a more engaged and motivated workforce that feels appreciated and valued for their contributions.
